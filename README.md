# KnockoutJS
Another small ASP.NET app that implements KnockoutJS, RequireJS, CrossroadsJS, HistoryJS & TextJS. The app demonstrates DI, component building, routing, data-binding, sorting, filtering & validation using the fore mention libraries.

This app demonstrates core functionality relating to KnockoutJS.

Topics covered include various ways in which to bind to controls and specific attributes, building components, event handling, validation and as a whole, provides one implementation for building an SPA.

With RequireJS, we are able to define and build modules of code in a clean and organized manner, which promotes better maintainability.

Routing is handled using the Crossroads and Signals libraries, browser history is controlled through HistoryJS, while we use TextJS for loading external html files.
